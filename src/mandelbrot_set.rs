// Mandelbrot set is used to refer to both a general class of fractal sets and to a particular instance
// of such a set. In general, a Mandelbrot set marks the set of points in the complex plane such that the
// corresponding Julia set is connected and not computable. The set was first defined and drawn by Robert
// W. Brooks and Peter Matelski in 1978, however in 1980 Benoit Mandelbrot obtained high quality visualizations 
// of the set while working at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center. 

// The Mandelbrot set has become popular outside of mathematics both for its aesthetic appeal and as an 
// example of a complex structure arising from the application of simple rules.
