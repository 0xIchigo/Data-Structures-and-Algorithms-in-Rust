// A Julia set, named after French mathematician Gaston Julia, is a set of complex numbers
// which do not converge to any limit when a given mapping is applied to them repeatedly. It
// has a complimentary set - the Fatou set, named after French mathematician Pierre Fatou.
// While less famous than the Mandelbrot set, the Julia set gives rise to breathtaking visuals
// all while expressing a complex and rich set of dynamics first explored in the 20th century.
