# Data Structures and Algorithms in Rust

### What are Data Structures and Algorithms?

A Data structure refers to a specific type of data organization, management, and storage format that is usually
optimized for accessing data efficiently. Essentially, it is a way of storing data that can be accessed, retrieved, 
accessed, and updated in a timely manner.

There are two types of data structures: linear and non-linear. A linear data structure is one in which its elements
are arranged sequentially where each element is attached to its neighbour whereas non-linear data structures are not
ordered sequentially and do not have to have any direct relation to its neighbour.

Examples of linear data structures include: arrays, queues, and linked lists. Examples of non-linear data structures 
include: trees and graphs.

An algorithm refers to a set of finite instructions typically used to solve a problem, perform a computation, or
accomplish a specific task. A recipie is a common example as it consists of a set of specific instructions for
preparing a certain meal. In computer science, algorithms are used as specifications for performing various 
calculations, data processing, and automated reasoning.

Learning data structures and algorithms gives insight on how to solve standard problems in an effective manner
all while teaching you how to evaluate the efficiency of an algorithm, or its runtime complexity.

### Time Complexity

Time complexity refers to the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm. Big O Notation is used to give a rough 
idea of how long an algorithm will take to run based on input size and the amount of steps it takes to complete 
the algorithm. We use Big O Notation to in terms of worst case scenario, so it doesn't matter if the program loops
ten or a million times if the rate of change is the same. 

For each data structure and algorithm I have added some comments at the top of their respective file going over
their runtime complexity using Big O Notation.
